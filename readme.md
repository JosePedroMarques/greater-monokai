# What is Greater Monokai?

It's a simple adaptation of the excellent [Monokai](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/monokai) color theme to IntelliJ IDEA, favoring "dark" choices, and optimized for Scala and Haskell.

The theme is also compatible with IntelliJ 12 (preview). It is particularly pleasent with the Darcula (Dark) theme:
